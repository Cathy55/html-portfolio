<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>We are all like Chihiro. When we were growing up, we once forgot ourselves. The white dragon that accompanies us symbolizes the love and warmth of mutual support, always reminding us to move forward firmly on the journey of finding ourselves.</p>

<h3>Toys Story 4</h3>
<p>From Forky who keeps getting lost, to Woody and the Shepherdess who finally let themselves go, you may feel relieved after watching this, or feel sorry for Woody and Buzz breaking up. However, you must understand after all that in life, apart from saying goodbye, you will also meet many wonderful people and things. The confusion at this moment is just a pause button, allowing you to look back and find that everything was not in vain.</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Time itself includes the past (history, the past of the world, our past, those that shape us), the present (what we experience, and constantly becoming the past at the same time), and the future (the unknown, which will be affected by the decision we made now and in the past). However, because love is not a substance, it will not be compressed and extended by time, space or gravity, and will become a force that can travel through or transcend time and space.</p>
